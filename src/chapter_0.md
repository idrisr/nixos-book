# About The Author

I started using Nix and NixOS almost three years ago, driven by frustration: I
was learning Haskell, and setting up a stable dev environment kept breaking.
Everywhere I turned—IRC, blog posts, StackOverflow—Nix was whispering from the
edges. Eventually, I gave it a shot.

Since then, I’ve gone from Ubuntu and macOS to running NixOS exclusively.

I’ve read a lot—maybe too much. Eelco’s thesis (twice), the Nix Pills (four
times), hours (months) tinkering with configs just to make my machine do normal things.
Somewhere in that struggle, I became a fanboy. Now, I think I’m on the verge of
“getting it.” With Nix, that’s always a moving target.

These notes are an attempt to externalize what I’ve learned: not just how to use
Nix, but why it works the way it does. Most tutorials show you what to type. I
want to explore what’s really happening underneath.

Nix can feel uncanny because:

* Sometimes it feels like Haskell: abstract, pure, intimidating.
* Sometimes it looks like YAML: declarative, structured, deceptively simple.
* Sometimes it reads like arcane Bash: full of special character operators and shell-isms.

These mismatched metaphors create friction. This project is my attempt to smooth it out.
